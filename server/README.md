# Pick'em League Assistant — `chat.py`

FastAPI service that powers **Picky**, the league assistant chat on the
leaderboard page. Runs on the Mac mini under LaunchAgent `com.pickem.chat`,
listens on `127.0.0.1:8766`, reached from github.io through the Cloudflare
tunnel at `picky.dunecreek.ai`.

## What it does

- Validates the caller's Supabase JWT via `/auth/v1/user` (no secret stored).
- Pulls a compact snapshot of league state from Supabase **using the
  caller's JWT**, so row-level security applies to everything.
- Builds a system prompt in Picky's voice and calls Ollama's
  `/api/chat` streaming endpoint, forwarded back as SSE.
- Rate-limits 10 req/min per user, in-memory.
- Warms the model on startup so the first query of the day doesn't eat
  a ~20 s cold start.

Errors: `401` bad/missing token · `429` rate-limited · `502` Ollama or
Supabase unreachable · `500` otherwise. Streamed error chunks look like
`data: {"error": "..."}`.
